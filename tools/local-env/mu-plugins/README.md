# Must Use Plugins

Simple plugins which are used in local development and which are installed as Must Use Plugins
into `wp-content/mu-plugins` instead of `wp-content/plugins`.

In WordPress navigate to Plugins page and click the "Must-Use" filter at the top to see these plugins, they are not
listed otherwise.
